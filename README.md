NickMod is a simple 1.8.9 Minecraft Forge mod that changes the player's name in chat to a nickname of their choice.

Use /nickmod or /nm to get started. You are able to change the color of your name and give yourself a custom nickname. NickMod is client-side only, and your nickname or color will not show up for other people.
